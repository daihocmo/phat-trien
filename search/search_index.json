The most secure app in the world won't help if you're engaging in stupid and risky behavior. Before you do or say anything, ask yourself if the potential risks outweigh the benefits. Remember that anything said online is permanent and can be shared with anyone.</li> <li>IP address: An IP address, or IP, is a unique identifier your computer receives when connecting to the Internet. Your IP identifies your general location, and in some cases can be traced to your personal identity. Your IP can be hidden through a proxy or VPN.</li> <li>VPNs: A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a program that encrypts your Intemet traffic and routes it through a different computer. This hides your true IP address from websites that you visit, and also hides your traffic from your ISP. However, both your true IP address and your Internet traffic are fully visible to your VPN provider, so VPNs are not 100% safe.</li> <li>TOR: TOR, or The Onion Router, is a program that encrypts and routes your Internet traffic through multiple other computers in a way that no single computer knows both your true identity and the traffic you are sending. Although there are limits to its usefulness, TOR is generally more secure than a VPN. TOR+VPN is actually less safe than just TOR (usually). - Encryption: Encryption is a process that encodes a message so that only the sender and intended recipient can decode it and read it. End-to-end encryption is essential for any messaging application to be truly secure; otherwise messages can be easily intercepted and read by third parties.</li> <li>Open-source: \"Open-source\" means that the source code used for a program is publicly available. In other words, programs that are proprietary (not open-source) can have hidden functionality, which often includes tracking. Try to only use software that is open-source.</li> <li>Browser: Use an open-source browser. Ensure your browser settings prevent your browser from tracking you. Use add-ons like uBlock Origin, HTTPS Everywhere, and NoScript.</li> <li>Websites and apps: If possible, avoid using web services known to engage in tracking, such as Google Search or Facebook. Don't give out info to websites that they don't need, such as your name or phone number. Remember, any application that stores your data on a server you don't own, such as Gmail or Discord, has access to all of your data. Websites or apps that offer data hosting or other services for \"free\" are often selling your data or can be compromised in other ways. Be careful and do your research. \u2022Don't buy wiretaps like Amazon Alexa. Treat any device with a microphone or webcam as if it is always on. This One-Page Guide is part of the Foundation Guide to Self-Improvement. Look up the full book for free info on privacy and many more topics.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"doc-sach/","title":"\u0110\u1ecdc s\u00e1ch","text":""},{"location":"doc-sach/#oc-sach","title":"\u0110\u1ecdc s\u00e1ch","text":"<p>C\u00f3 c\u1ea3 t\u00e1 nh\u1eefng h\u01b0\u1edbng d\u1eabn v\u1ec1 ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n b\u1ea3n th\u00e2n, v\u00e2n v\u00e2n v\u00e0 v\u00e2n v\u00e2n n\u00f3i v\u1ec1 nh\u1eefng l\u1ee3i \u00edch, l\u00fd do, t\u1ea1i sao \u0111\u1ecdc s\u00e1ch n\u00ean m\u00ecnh s\u1ebd kh\u00f4ng nhai l\u1ea1i n\u1eefa.</p> <p>Nh\u01b0ng n\u00f3 qu\u00e1 chung chung, v\u00e0 c\u00f3 l\u1ebd c\u1ea7n \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c s\u1eeda l\u1ea1i.</p> <p>\u0110\u1ecdc s\u00e1ch n\u00ean ch\u1ec9 b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u \u0111\u01a1n gi\u1ea3n l\u00e0 v\u00ec b\u1ea1n th\u00edch \u0111\u1ecdc (Ti\u1ec3u thuy\u1ebft, s\u00e1ch khoa h\u1ecdc) ho\u1eb7c \u0111\u1ec3 t\u00ecm ki\u1ebfm nh\u1eefng th\u00f4ng tin m\u00e0 b\u1ea1n mu\u1ed1n t\u00ecm hi\u1ec3u th\u00eam (T\u1edbi \u0111\u00e2y c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 s\u1ebd c\u00f3 nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi ch\u00eca c\u00e1i \u0111i\u1ec7n tho\u1ea1i ra v\u00e0 truy c\u1eadp Google.com nh\u01b0ng kh\u00f4ng.

Discover why most people can't motivate themselves effectively, and how to set goals the right way! Comments appreciated! (self.FoundationGuide)</p> <p>The following is part of the first chapter to a comprehensive guide to self-improvement. I'm in the process of writing it, and it will cover topics like Motivation, Socializing, Fitness, Diet, Grooming, Dating, Occupation, and much more. When I'm done the book will be released for free in its entirety. If you are interested in contributing, I would love your help! Please leave a comment below to share your thoughts, and/or join the subreddit here at /r/FoundationGuide. Thanks!</p> <p>I. The Problem of Motivation Many people see motivation backwards to the way it actually works. Perhaps you think that first you must get motivated, and that gives you the energy to accomplish things. That is backwards. Typically, people accomplish things, and that success motivates them to do more.</p> <p>Remember that motivation is an emotion. Emotions do not come from nowhere \u2013 they are a response to your circumstances.</p> <p>Your circumstances include your health, your home, your relationship (or lack of relationship), your job (or lack of job), your friendships, your accomplishments, and other aspects of your life.</p> <p>Typically, very motivated people have good circumstances, while very unmotivated people have bad circumstances. Your circumstances drive your motivation, which in turn impacts your circumstances.</p> <p>The good news is that you have the power to change your circumstances, even with very little motivation. Improving your circumstances will boost your motivation, starting a cycle that leads to a better life.</p> <p>II. The Solution Don\u2019t focus on getting motivated. Instead, focus on making small, concrete steps that improve your life in measurable ways. Motivation will naturally follow.</p> <p>No step is too small.</p> <p>Focus on Health (water, food, sleep, anything else), Hygiene, Home, Family/Friends, Job, Hobbies/Interests/Anything Else in that order.</p> <p>To start with: If you are reading this and your Health is lacking \u2013 if you are thirsty, hungry, tired, or unhealthy in any way \u2013 take care of that immediately. Get water to drink, food to eat, or go to bed.</p> <p>If you are not taking care of your physical needs, your mood and the rest of your life will be negatively affected. On the other hand, if you are sleeping enough, eating well, and drinking enough water, your mood will be boosted along with your physical wellbeing.</p> <p>After Health comes Hygiene. If you feel dirty, you will feel unmotivated. If you have not done so, do the following: brush your teeth, wash your face, shower, comb your hair, or shave. If your hair is too long or messy, get a haircut. Even minor changes like these can greatly improve your outlook on life.</p> <p>After Hygiene comes Home. If your room is dirty, clean it. If you are seriously unmotivated, even that may be too demanding \u2013 instead, simply make your bed. This is one of the reasons why JBP says to clean your room; a clean and organized environment leads to greater motivation and sense of efficacy.</p> <p>After taking care of your Home comes being with Family and Friends. In some ways, this is the most important part. If you are depressed or suffering, your friends and family would be happy to help you. Call them up and ask for help. Even if you are not in a bad mood, face-to-face socializing is extremely important to human wellbeing.</p> <p>The key takeaway is that your mood is highly dependent on your lifestyle. Eat well, drink well, get enough sleep, take care of your hygiene, be active, and be social with friends and family. All of these things will make you happier and boost your motivation.</p> <p>III. View Goals and Objectives Correctly Similar to misinterpreting motivation, many people confuse goals and objectives, or do not know how to set goals properly. You may be familiar with this if you set a New Years Resolution, only to confront it again months later and find you have made no progress.</p> <p>Think of a goal like a goal in sports. The goal of soccer is to get the ball through the net at the end of the field. However, although every soccer team is trying to accomplish that goal, none of them set \"get the ball through the net\" as their strategy. That would be way too simple! Instead, soccer players set objectives, such as \"pass the ball to my friend\" or \"dodge that opposing player\", that are prerequisites to achieving their goal.</p> <p>In other words, a goal is generally a far-off aspiration, while an objective is something you can do right now. \"Get physically fit\" is a goal; \"get dressed and go to the gym\" is an objective. \"Be healthier\" is a goal; \"make a doctor's appointment\" is an objective.</p> <p>In general, think in terms of objectives, not in terms of goals. Whenever you set a goal, consider the smaller objectives you will need to perform in order to reach that goal. This will keep your focus on the tasks at hand that lead to real progress.</p> <p>[This chapter is still a work in progress; if you liked it, or if you have any criticism or suggestions to share, please leave a comment below! Merry Christmas!]</p> <p>GET MOTIVATED Remember there are many people in the same position as you. You are not alone. Make achievable, quantifiable goals. Goals should be very specific. For example, rather than setting a goal to \"clean my room\", say \"make the bed\". The latter is more specific and achievable. Setting even a small goal and achieving it is far more confidence-boosting than setting a big goal and failing to achieve it. - Don't bite off more than you can chew. Going cold-turkey almost never works, and should you fail, it will only hurt your self-esteem. Rather than trying to change your life overnight, make a small commitment like \"I will make my bed today,\" or \"I won't drink soda today.\" Try making a small positive commitment for today right now. If you have trouble getting out of bed: Set your alarm away from your bed, so you have to get up to use it. Set alarms on multiple devices, one outside your room. If you're addicted to using your phone after you wake up, buy an old-school alarm clock. Finally, wear warm clothes to bed so it's not too cold to get up in the moming. \u26abFor overcoming addiction: Since we give into temptation mostly when we are weak-willed, if you make it more effort to give into temptation, then you will do it less. For phone or computer addiction, lock your phone or computer in your car overnight, or put them in another room. You can also lock away an essential piece, such as a PC power cord or phone charger.</p> <p>One way to cut down on addictions is to turn them into delayed rewards.</p> <p>For example, rather than trying to do NoFap cold turkey, you could promise yourself \"I will abstain from fapping until my birthday in 2 weeks.\"You can also turn addictions into rewards for tasks completed, such as \"I will only have a piece of cake after I get this difficult assignment done.\" Alternatively, you can set limits on how often you do bad activities, for example \"I will only smoke once a week.\"</p> <ul> <li>Don't underestimate the power of socializing and work, and sleeping and eating right. Keeping yourself busy, and avoiding isolation, will improve your mood and cut down on bad habits. Try to sleep 8 hours a night and eat healthy foods regularly. Your physical health has a significant impact on your mood.</li> <li>If necessary, seek professional help from a therapist or psychologist.

If you do this, eventually you'll be able to fall asleep in 5 minutes because the bed will be a clear cue to your brain to fall asleep. 6) I struggle to go to bed early when I use my phone right before bed because I don't feel like leaving the phone. I end up procrastinating sleep. 7) Sleep 7-9 hours according to your body's natural inclination. 8) Avoid day naps. 20 min max, and before 5 pm if you really need it. 9) If you're in the bed and can't sleep. Get up and read a book till you feel sleepy. Don't toss and turn around for hours. You don't wanna associate your bed with that anxiety. 10) Follow the same sleep schedule everyday.</p> <p>PS- using your phone in bed is a deadly bad habit. It'll likely indirectly hurt your life expectancy.</p>"},{"location":"ghi-nho/","title":"Ghi nh\u1edb m\u1ecdi th\u1ee9","text":"<p>B\u00e0i vi\u1ebft g\u1ed1c thu\u1ed9c Voz Forum.

A lot of people succumb to negative thoughts or self-destructive mindsets because they are attached to the pop culture that promotes these things. It's sad, because you see your friends and family going out to see movies or watching shows that you know promote bad values. Many people do not even recognize these values are bad until it's too late.</p> <p>Regular people should start making culture ourselves. This can be something as simple as talking with friends rather than going out to see a Hollywood movie, or coming up with your own in-jokes instead of adopting them from the latest Netflix comedy show.</p> <p>It can also be something more in-depth, such as actually creating your own game, music, movie, story, or other art. However, the most important thing to consider is if your art will be valuable to yourself or others, rather than merely an escapist time-waster. Art should exist to promote good values, not as a distraction from the responsibilities and opportunities of daily life.</p> <p>In what ways do you think the average person could create or promote good culture?</p> <p>I agree with you, I'm still good friends with a person i met and worked with during a highschool competition. It taught me valuable lessons and how to communicate with people. Made some in-jokes about our incompetence as novices too.</p> <p>Try creating your own holidays. Our culture has a lot of holidays that either exist for crass, commercial reasons (Mother\u2019s Day, sorry Mom), or have been exploited as such (Christmas), or possibly never made sense in first place (St Patrick\u2019s Day).</p> <p>Why not create holidays for the things which are meaningful to you? That will remind you of what matters to you, that celebrates your values?</p> <p>I\u2019ve folded in a few existing non-holidays into my Calendar (420, Pi Day, Bicycle Day, May the 4th), in addition to making one or two out of whole cloth. In addition, last year I decided that January 1st was the stupidest day of the year to celebrate New Years, so I moved it to April 1st. Why not? For me, someone who takes self-improvement and reflection pretty seriously, and always made and then broke New Year\u2019s resolutions, I had the blinding inspiration that trying to improve myself in the dead of winter was making a hard task near impossible.</p> <p>I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Holidays today are often empty, vapid exercises in commercialism, totally devoid of whatever meaning they might once have held. So make the meaning yourself and celebrate your life.</p> <p>This is an excellent suggestion. It really is sad how empty holidays have become.</p> <p>Another suggestion could be to look to the past for inspiration with holidays, either adopting holidays that are no longer celebrated, or incorporating traditional aspects into holidays like Christmas to give them more substance than \"let's buy stuff\".</p>"},{"location":"grooming/","title":"Grooming Guide","text":"<p>GROOMING GUIDE (\u0110\u01b0\u1ee3c l\u1ea5y t\u1eeb FoundationGuide tr\u00ean Reddit, ch\u01b0a d\u1ecbch)</p> <p>WHAT YOU NEED</p> <p>Toothbrush, toothpaste, large electric trimmer (for beard/body hair), small electric trimmer (for nose hair/smaller hair), razor, shaving cream, soap, shampoo, conditioner, comb, hair dryer, hair product, nail clippers, deodorant, face wash (optional).</p> <p>DAILY</p> <ul> <li>Brush teeth: Start with a pea-sized piece of toothpaste.

For hard-to-reach hair, you can try using a depilatory cream.</li> <li>Less common: Trim nose hair with the smaller electric trimmer. Trim eyebrows, if necessary, by placing a comb over them and using the smaller trimmer on any hair that gets through the comb (you can also ask your barber to do this). To get rid of a unibrow, carefully shave away the center part between your eyebrows with a razor. Clean out ears (carefully).

However, because of this search for optimization I developed an eating disorder, orthorexia if you will, and while in treatment I began reading philosophy and psychology in order to understand what I had done wrong. After a month or so, I made the conclusion that I will find a meaning by the accumulation of things I do IN life, not find the meaning OF life - since there is no one defined meaning of life that is true for every organism, as every possible answer is debatable. I'd say, that even if you don't believe in this, it would be true that you will find meaning in the things you do when these actions or events are aimed at the overall meaning you think you believe \"instead of\" finding the meaning in the thing you have done. Feel completely free to correct me if you find any logical holes in my reasoning. The same is true for all of this post.</p> <p>Now, I didn't come here to debate philosophy, but to give you my guide and views of self-improvement on all aspects of a human being. This is because if you improve yourself as much as possible, you will increase the capacity for attaining most goals, at least as long as they are not about becoming \"worse\" in an area. I have therefore made a list that, although far from perfect, can be used for creating a structured plan in maximising your potential. It uses the knowledge of several books, podcasts, documentaries, YouTube-videos, articles and alike that I have consumed throughout my life.</p> <p>So what do I consider be the pillars of our potential? To start, you can make the categories of physical and mental abilities, which are intimately related. Then you also have the knowledge which you can apply through these two. The physical part is comprised of all the functions in your body and is the tool for interacting with your world. The mental part is then made out of your physical part, as it exists as an function within the intricate network of connections between all the neurons of the brain, just like your knowledge is. If you improve one part, you improve the others, just as you will become generally better at other sports if you perform another.</p> <p>And to my list now, with explaination of simple whys and hows for each item:</p> <p>Mental</p> <p>By improving your mental capabilities you will improve your core that controlls everything else</p> <ul> <li> <p>Meditation; There is loads of versions of this, and it can be aimed for general health, stress management, willpower training, well-being, improveme reasoning etc. Several other items on this list can be trained through meditation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hypnosis; This one is far from necessary, and is just a possible tool. I know it may seem like some kind of quackery, BUT I do have my reasons to include it since there evidence of it effectiveness. Read upon it and form an oppinion. Anyway, it can be used to rather easily induce desired attributes in our mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>Memory training; To do this, you can use any method and various exercises. I myself use the GMS-method. This is to dramatically increase your learning, which is very usefull for the acquiral of information that can help you in decision-making</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Courage training\"; It was hard to make a precise term for this, but in short it is the act of becoming familiar with challenging yourself, either throughout everyday life only or by adding complementary exercises. This is to reduce the risk of being hindered by challenges, or more specifically not succumb to fears. By not stopping yourself through excuses and telling yourself that \"this is dangerous\" when you logically KNOW that it isn't, you can perform actions that you need to, but don't do because you are simply too afraid of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Willpower training; This is done partly by some meditation, \"courage training\", hypnosis and specific exercises to facilitate motivation and \"drive\" you towards your goals. It is kind of the ability to push through, similary to \"courage training\", but instead of fighting fears you have a \"stronger will\" to work towards whatever goal you want. Call it becoming stubborn, or why not \"not giving up\", if you want.</p> </li> <li> <p>Social training; This is more specifically combined training that uses your knowledge of psychology, your willpower and the ability to challenge your social fears so that you improve your social interaction and increase the ability to influence others for your goals (or helping their goals, maybe?).</p> </li> <li> <p>Stress management training; This is essentially meditation, breathing techniques, challenge training, hypnosis and the specific action of deliberately relaxing without external input (media, games, TV etc.) when all combined and practiced in the long term. It is used to better manage stress and to reduce stress so that you prevent its influence on decision-making and also minimize symptoms of fatigue that decreases your abilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Musical/artistic training; This is entirely optional, but benficial nonetheless. You do this by things such as playing an instrument, drawing, painting, sculpting, designing, composing and writing. It is used to contribute towards most mental abilities such as memory and logical thinking, but also to develop creativity, expression of emotions or ideas, possibly controll emotions, stress management and simply well-being.</p> </li> <li> <p>Emotional training; A bit vague, but can be used for managing, controlling, distancing and reasoning about emotions as they arise. It can be practised by consciously telling yourself that you have a certain feeling, and then \"take a step back\" to observe it and think about why you feel that way, and if it makes things better.</p> </li> <li> <p>Philosophical/logical thinking; The act of thinking/discussing logical problems, moral questions, defitions of words and the causes of all things etc. It will increase reasoning, problem-solving and (hopefully) wellbeing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Positive-thinking-training; This is another optional and debatable item, but by being \"forgiving\" and \"kind\" to yourself, it can increase wellbeing.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Knowledge</p> <p>To make a solid basis of as correct information as possible for making decisions that are better aimed at your goal. Here it is health-focused.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Psychology; To, for example, identify psychological phenomena when they occur and how you can influence these to achieve goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Physiology; For knowledge of how to optimize/improve bodily functions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nutrition; To know how to optimize function in the body's various processes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specialized learning; To learn about and make use of knowledge in all possible subjects to achieve goals. You can learn whatever you want, that is.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Physical training</p> <p>To improve bodily functions</p> <ul> <li> <p>Strength training; Rather important for increasing bodily functions, well-being and reduce the risk of illness, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Condition/cardiovascular training; Just as important as strength training, it increase brain function, and of course to help the heart and reduce the risk of disease etc. You should absolutely include both at some point, but choose whatever proportion of effort you want between them. And DON'T do my mistake and become addicted to it, it will cost you too much in other areas. Recovery is absolutely essential to gaining any benefits from it. If you feel that you are not recovered (and you will know), be sure to stop for a moment. Observe what you are doing, and why.</p> </li> <li> <p>Breathing Exercise; This is related to meditation and stress management training, but by doing this you can improve oxygen uptake (just as with other physical training) you can reduce stress and make relaxation easier. Just do not neglect it completely because of this.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mobility and flexibility training; Not necessary, but quite beneficial for reducing injury risk and optimize the effect of strength/cardiovascular training by the increase of range of motion. It can also provide relaxation. This is debated, though.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance training; Not necessary, but can be beneficial to reduce injury risk. Much of it comes through other training</p> </li> </ul> <p>Ok, so this became a longer post than intended. I may seem... very extreme with all this, but it is just a framework for making a complete \"training program\" by using periodization of your focus while keeping some basic things at all times. Begin with just meditating for 10 minutes a day, and maybe after a month you are meditating 20, 40 or 60 minutes. Then you can add memory training, and so on. Combine it as you like. My personal and \"final\" goal is to have implemented all of these wtihin 40 years, so I have basically all of my life to do so. And for this month, I have the goal of meditating 30 minutes a day, and 40 minutes the next. Think of the athlete that focuses on different things at different times, or else he might get overtrained - or not. It depends on you, your effort, goals, views, environment and the rest of the universe, even particles at quantum-levels.</p> <p>I don't want to induce stress or give you all anxiety over optimizing every aspect of your life. This would literally counteract the intent of improvement. \"Just\" don't overdo it. If done \"correctly\", you will be able to prevent obsessions of optimization by for example thinking about why you are doing something and then ask if what you do is \"balanced\". Do you need 10 percent more cardiovascular training, if you would be better of doing 100 percent more meditation, or 200 percent more on learning about something you like. It is the whole that counts, just as the best house and most sustainable house can not consist of only planks. You need nails, some tools to put them together and cutting them, something to measure things so that they fit where they should, a foundation to set them on, isolation for warmth when it's done, paint to protect the walls from the weather, a roof and so on. Only then should you go on adding comfort appliances and decorations such as windows and heating systems. The big problem is that it is hard to know what is the best way to build your house, as it is you that decides how you want it and not a single person around you. Listen to those - as in a little from several and not all from one source - who have designated their lifes to their field, and then think of what is most applicable to you. So, don't be too experimental trying every single thing out there at once, and choose one (POSSIBLY two if it's a really easy goal, but be careful) thing at a time so you can make it througly. You only need it to be good enough for it to stay where you left it and not so throughly that you can not keep it where it is when you go onto something else. When you have the foundation, specialize in whatever you find being the best for your situation and goals. Write down what YOU want, and then what YOU need to do that. Then tell yourself that if you want that, you will do this. And DO the work, not theorize over it for hours on end. All results comes from action and a recompensating recovery, and if your action is only reading about the topic forever and never applying it because you want it to be perfect, you'll just lose the time needed for your actions to grow into results. You can have a million seeds and be the most educated expert in the world on planting this particular seed, but if you never sow it or sow it a week before you die, you can never harvest any crops.</p> <p>Lastly, I want to remind you that it is your life after all, so go do whatever with it. Others may want you to fail or succed, but you also have a will which is yours only. And this is just a resource of swiftly organized instructions for helping you reach your goal, if you have any. I thought that it would have helped me, as perfectionist as I am...</p> <p>Now, do the work - Nothing makes nothing, something makes something. Start with your goal on a paper.</p> <p>Edits so far: formatting and wording, renaming \"challenge training\" to \"courage training\", adding some text.</p>"},{"location":"lam-vuon/","title":"Lam vuon","text":"<p>If you aren't starting a garden, you aren't quarantining correctly (self.FoundationGuide)</p> <p>Going out to supermarkets will become increasingly risky due to infections, and who knows if either the virus or the recession will disrupt supply chains enough to make doing so difficult or impossible.</p> <p>So if you have seeds, or are able to get them, start a garden as soon as possible!</p> <p>Gardening may be a lot easier than you think. As long as you have soil, seeds, and water, you can probably grow a plant with no problem. My recommendation is green beans, since they sprout quickly, but you can try other plants as well. Potatoes are an excellent choice. Be sure to watch out for pests - consider buying non-toxic fencing and human-safe organic pesticides.</p> <p>There are other ways to increase your food security as well, and this thread is open to all suggestions (but especially tips on how to garden).

Can I write a process up that can be given to someone to follow? Can I follow up on something sooner/ build in an earlier review step so it doesn\u2019t end up back with me only once it is urgent?

Start small at least 1-2 goals.</p> <p>STEPS: (For beginners and self employed who also struggles with interruptions: The steps 1-7 must be met in order for it to be successful.)  </p> <ol> <li>At least try to schedule your day the night before given that you have already also sched your long term goals in advance.  </li> <li>Wake up earlier (gives you mental edge). and start your day early  </li> <li>have a list of what you need to do that day/tomorrow; list all tasks &amp; prioritize.  </li> <li>Have a consistent time of waking up, and a good sleep.  </li> <li>Have a morning routine that would get you ready to tackle your day  </li> <li>All meetings, appointments, classes lay it all out in your calendar.  </li> <li>Have at least a consistent time for breakfast/lunch/dinner then sched it 8.Time block your calendar on weekdays ONLY from 5 am OR 6 am - 1pm OR 2pm. (weekends would serve as your \"anything goes\" days and rest days). 9.Lay out first all your hard commitments, appointments, meetings, classes etc.  </li> <li>Sched what time you will wake up and do the morning routines together with breakfast and lunch.  </li> <li>Then layout all your FOCUS or long terms goals that you need to accomplish that day not the mundane tasks like house chores . e.g. By the end of the month of June I want to learn how to play Piano. so for 30 or 20 days up until the End of the month You will block out time in your calendar at a consistent time. depends on how long you want to practice for a day. This should be around mornings. </li> <li>time block at least an exercise, whether 20m or 1hr.  </li> <li>batch all your similar tasks that are not the focus of your day and keep it on a list  </li> <li>Time block a chunk of time at least 1-2hrs where you would do the step 13</li> </ol> <p>We only blocked out the first half of your day or mornings for us to have a room for mistakes and alterations during the day. and during afternoons are the interruptions.</p> <p>I prefer to sched my day with context switch between FOCUSed tasks and mundane tasks to stay excited and motivated The prioritization is up to you.</p> <p>E.g. 5am-5:30am = morning routine 5:30am-7am = learn programming(focused goal) 7am-8:30am = Exercise 8:30am-10am = mundane tasks 10am-11am = Breakfast</p> <p>11am-12pm would be a vacant period, it is a time to catch up if I am little behind schedule or if I want to do something else, tasks, shower, clean the room - in short a room for spontaneity .</p> <p>12pm-1:30pm = learn programming(focused goal)</p> <p>the rest of the day is vacant, if you have an urgent tasks or you want to finish a task or you want to go somewhere else or you have a meeting it's all up to you.</p> <p>8pm-9pm = Dinner</p> <p>__notice that I did not schedule mundane tasks right after my focused goal, this would just give me burn out I need to switch my brain off and enjoy and yet I am being productive.*</p> <p>This might be my schedule for a day in my one month goal, given I don't have any meetings and appointments.</p> <p>The weekends and later half of the days are the room for spontaneity. You just have to focus on the progress that you are making and not focus if you have not finish the task. e.g. during the chunk of 2hrs of mundane tasks and you have 2-3 remaining tasks (in order of priority) that you have not finish, just let it go and move on and follow the schedule, because later in the day you have time for it. OR you have finished the most important one already.</p> <p>TIP 1. have a fake deadline for mundane tasks or A do date and a due date 2. use Eisenhower matrix for prioritization. start small 3. Avoid social media, or emails- unless your work is based on emails,, for your first few hours upon waking up. 4. do not be afraid to reschedule as necessary. 5. Being well rested and waking up early is the secret.</p> <p>You can be lazy yet productive you just have to be disciplined. __The key is start earlier**</p> <p>For those who have a job. build a schedule around your work schedule, OR do this technique on weekends \u200b</p> <p>Just want to share it, thank you</p>"},{"location":"nguoi-nghe/","title":"Tr\u1edf th\u00e0nh ng\u01b0\u1eddi nghe","text":""},{"location":"nguoi-nghe/#how-to-become-a-listener","title":"How to become a listener","text":"<p>My first thought was that you\u2019re not seeing your interlocutor as someone worth your time and attention. When we have a connection with people, we start to find value in interacting with them, be it the recipient of love, a great story, help with work, whatever, it\u2019s easier to find them to be more worthy of your attention.</p> <p>Next time You\u2019re going to be seeing someone, think beforehand what it is that you feel about this person, what about this person sparks interest to you, try to find something that will form a connection. And then put in the work to deepen the connection with this person. It\u2019ll help you care more about them and translate into listening better to them.</p> <p>In my experience, people like you\u2019re describing yourself to be lack the social skills to create and maintain a genuine connection with others. The good news is that social skills are exactly what they\u2019re called: a skill. You can learn to do this and it can become easier.</p> <p>Now, I suggest doing this with people that you care about, that you want a relationship or friendship with. Screw everyone else. You don\u2019t owe them anything. :)</p>"},{"location":"nguoi-nghe/#how-to-2","title":"How to 2","text":"<p>I was raised by a compulsive talker. I think it was mostly born of anxiety on her part. As a result, I became a compulsive talker and a terrible listener.</p> <p>Now I can't change her, but I certainly could change me. I noticed when I was talking with people that their eyes would glaze over. That was when I realized I had taken more than my share of the conversation. I had to make a concerted effort to watch for it and to edit myself.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong, it's hard work, but it's doable.</p> <p>The first thing I do is when I meet someone, or when I see someone, after saying hello is asking, \"How are you?\". The key is then to listen to their answer. If they don't return the question, don't tell them how you are.</p> <p>It took work, but I have been told that I'm a good listener, which for me is high praise.</p> <p>I had to change my outlook on conversation. I decided to find my power not in what I said, but what I didn't say.</p> <p>You know when you're listening to someone, but you're not really listening, you're just rehearsing what you're going to say? If you focus right, you'll forget what you were going to say. I call that a win.</p> <p>I actually find pleasure in the fact that I can walk away from a conversation realizing that no one asked me how I was or how things were going. I made it all about them. It's actually quite empowering.</p> <p>It's also cut way down on the 2:00 a.m. self-flagellations. You know what those are? When you wake up at 2:00 in the morning and think to yourself, \"Ooooh my goodness, did I really say that?\"</p> <p>Start small, take pleasure in your wins. You can do this. And I guarantee, the better listener you are, the more likely people will engage you in conversation.</p> <p>I feel like maybe your eyes are glazing over reading this. So, how are you?</p>"},{"location":"nguoi-nghe/#how-to-3","title":"How to 3","text":"<p>Most people listen to respond, not to understand. We're eager to speak as if we're waiting our turn but our turn can't come fast enough. We end up speaking before it's valid, because what we say matters more than their thoughts.</p> <p>This is wrong. This is not a problem others can't fix for you. You need to do this yourself. Practice staying quiet more. When you're by yourself, focus on your goals, that'll create happiness within you. And the byproduct would be a better social battery. When in a conversation, ask questions like:</p> <ol> <li>Tell me more.</li> <li>And then what happened?</li> <li>So if i understand you correctly, this, this, and this happened. And it made you feel this way. Is that right? Is that how you feel? (btw, this one is great with the ladies)</li> <li>So what are you gonna do now? (great with men)</li> <li>And how did that make you feel?</li> </ol> <p>And don't forget to look them in their eyes. With a smile behind your own.</p> <p>The listen and repeat will get you alot of jobs in interviews. I always would listen to their question and assuming it isn't, tell me about yourself, I rephrase it as its own sentence maybe with some inflection to show I'm processing. This is great in a work setting as whoever is speaking to you will feel heard and confident in their message being understood.</p> <p>People like you more when you let them talk. And people love to talk about themselves. So if we can just learn to listen, it'll be good for both parties, and for the society. I believe the term for that is active listening. Where you engage the other person to make them feel heard and understood. Very useful in dating.

Think of a conversation like a train. You let the conversation run it's course because, if you try to stop it and go back to somewhere, you end up jarring everything up. If the point was super important, you'll remember it and come back to it when the situation arises.</li> <li>It really is up to you to be genuinely interested in what someone is saying. This is harder than it sounds, simply put, many people are just boring. They don't interest you or the topic of discussion doesn't interest you. I know, it sucks, but if you care about the person enough, you'll put in the effort.</li> <li>Remember to bounce the conversation back.    \"Is that a new shirt?\"    \"Yes it is, thank you for noticing! I got it at Macys. Do you like to shop in department stores or online?\" \"Oh definitely department stores, I always need to try things on!\"</li> </ol> <p>Then next time you have to shop, suggest a department store, mention how much you like to try things on before you buy them.

One thing I would recommend is learning different stretches and practicing them daily (for at least 30 minutes). Also, </p> <p>if you do a LIGHT WARM-UP (some jogging or light cardio) for a few minutes before you start stretching, that will help you to \"warm up\" your muscles. </p> <p>Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated </p> <p>a healthy diet (fruits, veggies, lean meats, calcium-rich foods/beverages, that kind of stuff) and also try to have a healthy breakfast everyday if you're able to.</p> <p>When you're stretching, don't overdo it! </p> <p>I cannot stress this enough! Stretch until you feel a slight burn and hold it there for several seconds, and DO NOT BOUNCE THE MUSCLES!!!! This puts unneeded stress on your joints and muscles. Instead, stretch in a slow, fluid motion. When stretching, you should feel some discomfort, but it should not be downright painful. I would also recommend working with someone experienced with proper stretching techniques (an instructor, physical trainer, knowledgeable friend) for a few days as well to teach you different stretches and to make certain you're doing them correctly.</p> <p>Aerobics help in the sense that they can warm up your muscles beforehand (Atomic Habit). </p> <p>How long should you hold a given stretch?</p> <p>Longer if older and inflexible. The stretch reflex can last up to 45s in some people. My advice is always 60s, because it covers this base AND helps scale intensity - what you can hold for 60s is significantly different that what you can hold for 10s</p>"},{"location":"the-duc/#where-do-i-start","title":"Where do I start?","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Starting To Stretch is a basic stretching routine for overall flexibility.

My name is dontgoonreddit and I once submitted a post here called \"the ultimate guide to self-improvement\". Since then, I have found quite a lot of good new ideas to improve yourself so I'm going to make a new, and hopefully more helpful, submission. English is not my native language, so please excuse language mistakes.</p> <p>What was the old post about?</p> <p>The old post was actually way too long, but I'll try to make it as short as possible here: what most people on this subreddit lack are not ideas on what they could do to improve their lives, but some step between reading those ideas and actually implementing them in their lives. I have found out that it is very helpful to make a list of all those ideas and read it twice a day. This is very simple, but it is the necessary step between finding the information and actually using it.</p> <p>And what are your new ideas?</p> <p>The answer is simple: even more lists. First of all, I have now a much longer list. The old post featured a rather short list with long explanations for every point. I'll leave out the explanation to the list points in this post, but feel free to write a comment when you don't understand why I added a certain point to my list.</p> <p>The second one is kind of similar, it is a table where every column stands for one day and every row stands for a certain activity you want to do or avoid doing (e.g. \"having studied\", \"not having watched porn\", \"having read a book\", \"having practiced an instrument\", \"having talked to at least one stranger\", ...). Every day, you just make an x in every cell of the table when you did the activity and you try to get as much xs as you can. Notice that I'm not talking about a calendar with different appointments for every day, but rather a list of suggestions of what productive activities you could spend your time with.</p> <p>I know what you think, this stuff with the lists sounds too simple to make a difference in your life, but try it out for a few weeks and I promise you will feel huge improvements if you stick to the system I suggested.</p> <p>Now here is my new list with ideas and stuff on how to live an awesome life, this time without the explanations, but much longer:</p> <ul> <li>learn about whatever interests you</li> <li>cold showers</li> <li>pay attention to your body language</li> <li>work out</li> <li>minimize your daily use of electronic devices</li> <li>meditation</li> <li>spend time in nature</li> <li>try to be helpful but take care not to be exploited</li> <li>do not watch porn</li> <li>limit your alcohol intake</li> <li>pay attention to having a good posture</li> <li>read</li> <li>go to bed early and rise early</li> <li>drink water</li> <li>don't give a fuck</li> <li>when you're reluctant to do something, count 1... 2... 3... and it gets a lot easier overcome your fear</li> <li>use the table I described above (the one with the xs)</li> <li>when a task takes one minute or less, do it immediately</li> <li>try not to look at a computer screen at least one hour before you go to bed to improve your sleep</li> <li>listen to music while doing tasks that don't require your full attention to make them more fun</li> <li>use an app like Anki to learn and revise</li> <li>never visit sites that give you an unlimited amount of entertainment (like YouTube, subreddits about entertainment, meme sites, ...). Seriously, quitting memes was almost as hard for me as quitting porn.</li> <li>try to engage people in conversations</li> <li>don't lick your lips, especially when it's cold or windy</li> <li>try to talk to at least one stranger every day</li> <li>look people in the eyes</li> <li>never break eye contact with someone before they break it with you</li> <li>watch movies/ series or read books in a foreign language</li> <li>watch the news (without spending too much time on them)</li> <li>greet people</li> <li>smile</li> <li>have positive thoughts</li> <li>don't act needy towards women, men, or whatever you're attracted to... but especially not towards women</li> <li>eat healthy and cook your own food</li> <li>take some minutes every day to keep your home tidy</li> <li>be proactive (= don't let your life be formed by the circumstances but by your own actions)</li> <li>never over-consume anything</li> <li>talk slowly, loudly and clearly</li> <li>every day, take the time to think about what you like about yourself</li> <li>prepare for possible failures, but be optimistic</li> <li>be careful to trust girls that dye their hair</li> <li>don't complain about shit</li> <li>don't have big secrets in your life (things you wouldn't even tell your best friend or SO or whoever you trust a lot)</li> <li>realize that \"I don't have the time to do example activity\" means \"doing example activity has a very low priority for me\", it helps you better understand other people and yourself</li> <li>when you don't do an activity that would be good for you, go into yourself and think about whether you have valid reasons to hold you back or only made up excuses</li> <li>don't lay down in your bed if it is unnecessary, it makes you lazy and depressed</li> <li>have a big goal or purpose in your life you work for</li> <li>(learn about psycho-cybernetics)</li> </ul> <p>The last one is in brackets because I just discovered it two days ago and am not sure what to think of it. Some of it sounds logical, other parts sound like total bullshit backed up by anecdotal evidence... I'm going to make a new post in like a month when I have tried it out.</p> <p>Some points of this list are very personal and won't apply to every individual who reads this. For example, I should talk more slowly, but there are also people that should rather try to talk a little faster.</p> <p>I want to improve, but where should I start?</p> <p>You can copy my list, but it would be better if you wrote your own. Remember to read it twice a day. You should also make the table I suggested.</p> <p>Most importantly, start right now.</p> <p>Edit: I would also be happy if you posted more good list points I could add.</p>"},{"location":"tiny-habit/","title":"Th\u00f3i quen nguy\u00ean t\u1eed","text":"<p>How you can actually stick to new habits (for more than just a few days) - T\u00f3m t\u1eaft l\u00e0 th\u1ef1c hi\u1ec7n Atomic Habit.</p> <p>It\u2019s very weird when you feel really motivated and decided to make a change in your life and start positive habits (or stop negative ones) but all of a sudden, after a couple of days, that motivation fades out. For most people, this is a never-ending, lifelong struggle, and it sucks. They tell themselves stuff like: \u201cSomeday I will discipline myself and achieve my goals\u201d or \u201cSomeday I\u2019ll commit to my passions and work on them non-stop\u201d, except that they never do and they cling to the hope that \u201csomeday everything will change\u201d. Well, I was exactly like that until I got tired of waiting and decided to take action for myself. A couple of years (and failures) later and I can practically say I\u2019m a new person. Today, I want to share with you 4 keys that helped me stick to new habits. For good.</p> <ol> <li>Bring clarity to your mind. Sometimes, our \u201cgoals\u201d are actually very confusing and ambiguous by default. There\u2019s a HUGE difference between \u201cI want to lose weight\u201d and \u201c I want to lose 10 kilos by June 17th 2021. I will achieve this by going to the gym 4 times a week, counting my calories and keeping a workout journal so that I\u2019m able to track my progress and see my sticking points to correct them, week by week\u201d. Now, I\u2019m not a fitness expert but you get the point. Like Brian Tracy said, \u201ca goal without a plan is only a dream\u201d.</li> <li>Identify how you\u2019re most likely to fail. This key is very simple, hope for the best but plan for the worst. What has made you quit before? How can you avoid making that mistake again?</li> <li>Make it easy for you. Both to start and maintain the habit. Hard stuff creates resistance, resistance makes you quit. People get really excited when they are motivated, they want to start waking up at 5 a.m. and go for a 40 minute monday run followed by a cold shower and a 30 minute meditation session. Yeah that\u2019s not gonna happen overnight. Start with just one habit and start it simple. 30 minute meditation? Try just a 3 minute one every single day. You\u2019ll feel way less resistance and you\u2019ll be more likely to stick to it for more days, enough to integrate that habit into your \u201cNormality Line\u201d. You can worry about increasing the time after that.</li> <li>Go easy on yourself. Don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. Listen, you will fail, a lot. It is to be expected, and it\u2019s only natural when you start doing something you are not used to do. Failing isn\u2019t the problem, the problem is that many people completely give up once they slightly digress from the habit. They feel like they already failed and they go back to their old ways. Of course, this makes them feel very bad for months until one day, they suddenly get a burst of inspiration and decide that they are ready to make a change for real this time\u2026 Except they don\u2019t actually change their behaviors and the cycle repeats itself. Realize that you are in this for the long run and that patience pays. Please don\u2019t completely drop your progress when you fail, just learn from your mistakes and get ready to dominate the next day.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"tu-duy-du-lieu/","title":"Tu duy du lieu","text":"<p>Nhi\u1ec1u ng\u01b0\u1eddi th\u01b0\u1eddng b\u1ea3o l\u00e0m DA ko ph\u1ea3i ch\u1ec9 bi\u1ebft d\u00f9ng tool m\u00e0 c\u1ea7n c\u00f3 t\u01b0 duy logic, t\u01b0 duy ph\u00e2n t\u00edch insight.... bla bla.
