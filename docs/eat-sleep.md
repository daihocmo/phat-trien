1) Tập dậy sớm để có thể ngủ sớm
2) Tập luyện trong ngày trước hoàng hôn
3) Ăn tối 2 tiếng trước khi ngủ
4) Ngủ sớm hơn mỗi ngày 30 phút, có thể nhưng mà làm cái này khó quá 
5) Absolutely nothing but sleep on your bed. If you do this, eventually you'll be able to fall asleep in 5 minutes because the bed will be a clear cue to your brain to fall asleep.
6) I struggle to go to bed early when I use my phone right before bed because I don't feel like leaving the phone. I end up procrastinating sleep.
7) Sleep 7-9 hours according to your body's natural inclination.
8) Avoid day naps. 20 min max, and before 5 pm if you really need it.
9) If you're in the bed and can't sleep. Get up and read a book till you feel sleepy. Don't toss and turn around for hours. You don't wanna associate your bed with that anxiety.
10) Follow the same sleep schedule everyday.

PS- using your phone in bed is a deadly bad habit. It'll likely indirectly hurt your life expectancy.
