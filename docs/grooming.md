GROOMING GUIDE
WHAT YOU NEED
Toothbrush, toothpaste, large electric trimmer (for beard/body hair), small electric trimmer (for nose hair/smaller hair), razor, shaving cream, soap, shampoo, conditioner, comb, hair dryer, hair product, nail clippers, deodorant, face wash (optional).
DAILY
• Brush teeth: Start with a pea-sized piece of toothpaste. Gently brush your teeth, making sure to brush both sides. Rinse mouth with water. Brush in the morning and at night.
• Wash your face and use any acne products (if applicable).
• Shower: Rub shampoo thoroughly into your hair and rinse. Rub in conditioner, let sit a minute, then rinse out. Wash your body with soap, optionally exfoliating with a washcloth or loofah. Dry off by toweling your hair and body. Use the hair dryer on your hair, but don't overdry.
• Fix hair: Comb your hair into the style you want. Apply hair product (try a product with a light or medium hold) to keep your hair in place. Use hair dryer again if necessary.
• Shave: Rub shaving cream on your face. Lightly pull the razor across your face until the cream is gone. Repeat this, but pull the razor the other way for a closer shave.
• Apply deodorant under your arms.
• If going outside, apply sunscreen.
LESS REGULAR (every 2-3 weeks)
• Haircuts: Ask around to see which barber your friends use (as long as your friends have good hair). One popular hairstyle is shorter back and sides, longer on top and front. Consider bringing in a picture of a hairstyle you like to show the barber.
• Body hair: Trim this occasionally with the larger electric trimmer in areas that get too bushy. For hard-to-reach hair, you can try using a depilatory cream.
• Less common: Trim nose hair with the smaller electric trimmer. Trim eyebrows, if necessary, by placing a comb over them and using the smaller trimmer on any hair that gets through the comb (you can also ask your barber to do this). To get rid of a unibrow, carefully shave away the center part between your eyebrows with a razor. Clean out ears (carefully). Trim nails with nail clipper.
