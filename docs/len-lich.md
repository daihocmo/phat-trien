## Sắp xếp ưu tiên nhiệm vụ thông qua Eisenhower

Q1: Tasks that are due *today* 
Q2: Chronological list of tasks with due dates in the future (quick glance of what's coming up 
Q3: Tasks without a due date, but are still important (this gets the most activity for me) 
Q4: Tasks without a due date that aren't urgent

So for me, the left side is all items with a due date (typically recurring tasks), while the right is more one-off tasks to complete that don't have to be done by a certain time. The right side is only separated by priority (in TickTick, high priority goes in Q3, medium/low goes in Q4), but it's been super clear and helpful. I get through my tasks that are due today (Q1), then pivot to either getting ahead on tomorrow (Q2) or other high priority items (Q3).


2. I often find that identifying items that are Urgent - not important helps me think about how I can limit my time investment in the future. I have to do it now because it’s urgent and I can’t delegate but how can I change that for future occurrences? Can I train someone? Can I write a process up that can be given to someone to follow? Can I follow up on something sooner/ build in an earlier review step so it doesn’t end up back with me only once it is urgent? Solving/mitigating the issue of being urgent and not important is a task I’d place in my not urgent but important quadrant to deal with during planning phases of my week.
3. Define what you mean by "urgent and not important", or provide some examples.

I ask because, generally, these tend to be useless tasks that are better off skipped, but they present as immediate, demanding attention. Think unsolicited spam calls. Your phone is buzzing, it seems like something you have to deal with! But you're better off not even answering the call.

The flipside of this is when it's something that feels low/no priority, but is essential to keeping a key client or boss happy. And in those cases, I'd suggest either A) recognizing that this has a higher importance, or B) discussing it with that client or boss, and managing expectations.

> Q: So try to recognize these and then deal with them in an efficient manner (if need be) but ultimately try to make sure that these don't come up again?

> A: Basically. If it doesn't serve your larger goals -- completing big projects, meeting key objectives, etc. -- then it's either needless busywork (reduce or eliminate), or emerging requests from others. What you can't cut out entirely, I would defer and batch. Minimize and contain, because these sorts of things will swallow your schedule if you let them.


## Simple guide to structuring your day
Have a long term goals; daily/weekly/quarterly/monthly/yearly.  
This long term goals are the ones that would build structure for your days and weeks. These are the focus of your days, these goals are what you will put in your time blocks.  
put the due dates of your long term goals in the calendar weekly/quarterly/monthly/yearly. these long term goals usually be personal pursuits or businesses. goals that would make progress for your life. This must be the focus of your life. Start small at least 1-2 goals.

STEPS:  
1. At least try to schedule your day the night before given that you have already also sched your long term goals in advance.  
2. Wake up earlier (gives you mental edge). and start your day early  
3. have a list of what you need to do that day/tomorrow; list all tasks & prioritize.  
4. Have a consistent time of waking up, and a good sleep.  
5. Have a morning routine that would get you ready to tackle your day  
6. All meetings, appointments, classes lay it all out in your calendar.  
7. Have at least a consistent time for breakfast/lunch/dinner then sched it

For beginners and self employed who also struggles with interruptions:  
The steps 1-7 must be met in order for it to be successful.

8.Time block your calendar on weekdays ONLY from 5 am OR 6 am - 1pm OR 2pm. (weekends would serve as your "anything goes" days and rest days).  
9.Lay out first all your hard commitments, appointments, meetings, classes etc.  
10. Sched what time you will wake up and do the morning routines together with breakfast and lunch.  
11. Then layout all your FOCUS or long terms goals that you need to accomplish that day not the mundane tasks like house chores . _e.g. By the end of the month of June I want to learn how to play Piano. so for 30 or 20 days up until the End of the month You will block out time in your calendar at a consistent time. depends on how long you want to practice for a day. This should be around mornings._  
12. time block at least an exercise, whether 20m or 1hr.  
13. batch all your similar tasks that are not the focus of your day and keep it on a list  
14. Time block a chunk of time at least 1-2hrs where you would do the step 13

_We only blocked out the first half of your day or mornings for us to have a room for mistakes and alterations during the day. and during afternoons are the interruptions._

_I prefer to sched my day with context switch between FOCUSed tasks and mundane tasks to stay excited and motivated_  
_The prioritization is up to you._

E.g.  
5am-5:30am = morning routine  
5:30am-7am = learn programming(*focused goal*)  
7am-8:30am = Exercise  
8:30am-10am = mundane tasks  
10am-11am = Breakfast

11am-12pm _would be a vacant period, it is a time to catch up if I am little behind schedule or if I want to do something else, tasks, shower, clean the room - in short a room for spontaneity ._

12pm-1:30pm = learn programming(*focused goal*)

_the rest of the day is vacant, if you have an urgent tasks or you want to finish a task or you want to go somewhere else or you have a meeting it's all up to you._

8pm-9pm = Dinner

_\_notice that I did not schedule mundane tasks right after my focused goal, this would just give me burn out* I need to switch my brain off and enjoy and yet I am being productive.**

_This might be my schedule for a day in my one month goal, given I don't have any meetings and appointments._

The weekends and later half of the days are the room for spontaneity.  
You just have to focus on the progress that you are making and not focus if you have not finish the task.  
_e.g. during the chunk of 2hrs of mundane tasks and you have 2-3 remaining tasks (in order of priority) that you have not finish, just let it go and move on and follow the schedule, because later in the day you have time for it. OR you have finished the most important one already._

TIP  
1. have a fake deadline for mundane tasks or A do date and a due date  
2. use Eisenhower matrix for prioritization. _start small_  
3. Avoid social media, or emails- unless your work is based on emails,, for your first few hours upon waking up.  
4. do not be afraid to reschedule as necessary.  
5. Being well rested and waking up early is the secret.

_You can be lazy yet productive you just have to be disciplined._  
_\_The key is start earlier**

For those who have a job. build a schedule around your work schedule, OR do this technique on weekends
