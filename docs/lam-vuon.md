If you aren't starting a garden, you aren't quarantining correctly (self.FoundationGuide)

Going out to supermarkets will become increasingly risky due to infections, and who knows if either the virus or the recession will disrupt supply chains enough to make doing so difficult or impossible.

So if you have seeds, or are able to get them, start a garden as soon as possible!

Gardening may be a lot easier than you think. As long as you have soil, seeds, and water, you can probably grow a plant with no problem. My recommendation is green beans, since they sprout quickly, but you can try other plants as well. Potatoes are an excellent choice. Be sure to watch out for pests - consider buying non-toxic fencing and human-safe organic pesticides.

There are other ways to increase your food security as well, and this thread is open to all suggestions (but especially tips on how to garden). Fishing or hunting are also good ways to supplement your food stockpile. If there's one silver lining about this disease, it's that it will get more people thinking of how to be self-sufficient and provide for their own necessities.

Note: By start as soon as possible, I suspect he means start learning as soon as possible, figure out when the seeds should be planted in your region. Planting too early can kill or stunt the seeds. I'm still a week or two from planting lettuce and radish seeds even. And I can't do indoor sprouting because cats will just destroy it.
