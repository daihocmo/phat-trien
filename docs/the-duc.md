I grew up taking dance, so I eventually learned how to become flexible and maintain flexibility. One thing I would recommend is learning different stretches and practicing them daily (for at least 30 minutes). Also, 

if you do a LIGHT WARM-UP (some jogging or light cardio) for a few minutes before you start stretching, that will help you to "warm up" your muscles. 

Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated 

a healthy diet (fruits, veggies, lean meats, calcium-rich foods/beverages, that kind of stuff) and also try to have a healthy breakfast everyday if you're able to.

When you're stretching, don't overdo it! 

I cannot stress this enough! Stretch until you feel a slight burn and hold it there for several seconds, and **DO NOT BOUNCE THE MUSCLES!!!!** This puts unneeded stress on your joints and muscles. Instead, stretch in a slow, fluid motion. When stretching, you should feel some discomfort, but it should _not_ be downright painful. I would also recommend working with someone experienced with proper stretching techniques (an instructor, physical trainer, knowledgeable friend) for a few days as well to teach you different stretches and to make certain you're doing them correctly.

Aerobics help in the sense that they can warm up your muscles beforehand (Atomic Habit). 

> How long should you hold a given stretch?

Longer if older and inflexible. The stretch reflex can last up to 45s in some people. My advice is always 60s, because it covers this base AND helps scale intensity - what you can hold for 60s is significantly different that what you can hold for 10s


### Where do I start?
