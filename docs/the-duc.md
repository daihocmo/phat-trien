Thanks! Are there any other topics you would like to see addressed?

Hard to say, maybe exercises? Would be helpful with a simple guide like this compared to trying to crawl the internet for information. For example easy exercises that train chest, back, etc.

Good call! I'm working on that as well. My hope is to make this guide comprehensive and authoritative so people don't have to look anywhere else for good information. I've spent years scouring the internet and books for this sort of advice and sadly it's way too scattered right now.

Here's what I have for fitness so far. Any suggestions?

Quote: “The best workout is the one that you actually do.”

There are two kinds of workouts: Cardio and Strength Training.

Cardio (aka endurance training) helps with heart health and endurance.
Strength training builds muscle and strength.
Running and swimming help with cardio, while lifting weights helps with strength training.
A “rep”, short for repetition, is one isolated exercise. For example, a single push-up is one rep. A set is a collection of reps. Thus, 3 sets of 5 reps of push-ups is 15 push-ups (3x5).

Cardio: See "couch to 5k guide" for full info

Proper form: don’t cross arms across chest when running
For beginners: jog for 1 minute, walk for 1.5 minutes. Do this 4 times for a 10-minute run, or 8 times for a 20-minute run.
Strength Training: Calisthenics

(include diagrams of most important exercises)
Outline muscles: Abs, Pecs, Biceps, etc.
Push-ups: Place your hands on the ground about shoulder width apart. Lower yourself to the ground and rise.
Pull-ups: Grab on to an overhead bar. Using your arms, pull yourself up to the bar and back down.
Squats:
Sit-ups: Lie on a mat on your back, with your legs bent and feet flat on the mat. Keep your back straight, use your abs to pull your torso up to your legs.
(outline workout regimen)
What to eat?

Get protein after working out
Eat 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight

Nice work brother, sounds like you're well on your way. Maybe throw in some precautions, i.e. how to not destroy your back while lifting, not training only one part of your body, etc. I think maybe some sort of beginners guide could also help many get started, e.g. how someone can train themselves up to do a pull-up if they are not able to. An idea for another guide could be posture. Reasons why people get bad posture and ways to improve for example rounded shoulders. Just throwing out ideas, do what you feel like. The guide youre writing looks good. I appreciate the content.

Unfortunately I don't know enough about lifting to offer authoritative advice about it. I'm going to focus purely on calisthenics for this guide, although I will definitely state the importance of proper form and also gives readers links to more in-depth lifting guides.

Perfect suggestions. I'll be working on this for awhile but let me know if you run across any good guides with this type of info
