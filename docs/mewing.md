## pretty sure i’ve found the “secret” to mewing 
instead of pushing and swallowing the back third of the tongue to stick up and hold, try “pulling” the back third of ur tongue into ur throat without cutting off the airway. if u pull it back, ur tongue naturally raises and the suction hold become so much easier. try it. This is [the video](https://youtu.be/r2Hu62_F_SM)


## Guide for those who are unsure if they want to begin mewing OR need a 'lil help with their technique

mewing will always improve someone's looks, no matter what age they start or the baseline face shape or genetics or whatever else people will tell you. Genetics do of course play a huge part in mewing, and mewing will only get you to your genetic potential. If you are starting older it will take longer, but there will still be improvement. Mewing is the natural tongue posture, and when people don't mew and/or mouth breath, they loose this posture and the face "melts." The tongue is what supports the face, and all the attractive people I've asked say that they have their tongue on the top of their mouth.

To mew, put the tip of your tongue BEHIND the little ridge behind the gum line of your front teeth, There is a little hollow there, which is the natural place where the tongue is supposed to be. Once the tip of your tongue is there, swallow, and do a slight chin tuck. Then, maintain this position constantly. Eventually, you will wake up mewing and it will fell natural, as though you have done it all your life after a few months.

If you struggle with mouth breathing at night, sleep on your back WITHOUT a pillow. This helps with general posture, facial symmetry, and cheekbone development while mewing. Also, try mouth tape. I've heard that BreathRight strips help, and you can get them at Walmart.

Correct swallowing is also super important when it comes to mewing. Chubby cheeks are not genetic, whatever people tell you. There is a reason they are considered youthfully. Babies use their checks to do a sort of suction swallow when they are bottle feeding, which causes an increase in face fat and cheek muscles. This is the infant way to swallow, and most people never learned the way to swallow as an adult. No adult should have chubby cheeks, they should have hallow cheeks instead. To swallow correctly, chew the food as much as you possibly can, evenly on both sides of your mouth. Just doing this will make a lot of the food go down your through. For the rest of the food, put it on the top of your tongue and push up, with your lips slightly parted to prevent using checks and lips for suction. Drinking water is a good way to practice, as well as eating applesauce.

Also, try chewing as well. I used Falim gum for a couple months, and they grew my jaw muscles pretty fast. I would put one piece on each side on my teeth, and chew for an hour and a half a day. The reason I stopped is that I am a woman, and didn't want a super masculine jaw, but it's good news if you are a guy. There are tougher gums out there, but I can't testify to how they work because I've never tried them. Try chewing tough foods as well, like meant and carrots. Even if you don't eat these foods, just chew the food you already have super well until it turns into mush.

Finally, try calistenics and cardio. Loosing any fat will help your face look better, and gaining muscle in other places actually helps form your face. I recommend looking into Brae's YouTube channel.

Additionally, look into tongue chewing (not what you think lol). It's a little hard for me to explain, but Mike Mew made a video about it on the Orthotropics YouTube channel.



## How to ACTUALLY raise the back third of the tongue and mew properly (full tongue posture guide)

I’ve noted that many people are told that to mew simply say the letter N or NG and hold whatever position the tongue ends up in. You must be aware that the N “method” was described by Mike himself to just being effective to raise the tip of the tongue and maybe a little bit of the 2/3 onto the palate. There is tons of anecdotal evidence that only raising the 2/3 of the tongue will result in unwanted results such as a bulge forming in the sub mental region (giving you a more “recessed” look)

Instead, the PROPER way to mew is to follow the tropic premise: “glue” the entire tongue to the entire surface area of the palate by repeatedly swallowing and holding the position twice (or even four times to further reinforce the position of the tongue) and then apply gentle pressure on the mid palate ridge and especially the front ridges to influence facial upswing. This is especially important if you are heavily recessed and have a considerable amount of downwards growth. All this while keeping the back of the tongue glued on the palate and the tip of the tongue on the incisive papilla (Google search it, it’s just behind the front teeth) Back teeth (molars) should be in light contact (NOT apart but NOT clenching) to guide the forward and upwards growth of both the upper and lower jaw. Lips sealed.

Now- to swallow correctly see these two videos by Mike mew. Practice the excercises he mentions there

1. [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gcI8CvoFxfQ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gcI8CvoFxfQ)

2. [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lKaW3zNIuWY](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lKaW3zNIuWY)
    

These videos will help you learn how to swallow correctly and Mike even explains the postural version of the swallow to maintain throughout your day.

Some tips that you might need:

-Not being able to breath is due to lack of sufficient tongue space. Since you’re recessed you lack the space for your tongue to rest on the palate, especially the back. Simply practice holding the correct posture for a couple of minutes and then taking a break to breathe. Over time, the palate will expand to allow the tongue to rest on it comfortably allowing you to breathe.

-Make sure to have impeccable shoulder/head/neck posture before starting mewing

-Hard chewing for massater gains is useless without some months of mewing and correct maxillary growth. Chewing with a recessed jaw might increase your chances of developing TMJ and it will make your face more bloated in the long term since the jaw is pointing downwards, your face will look more rounded and not as sharp

- Everything past the tropic premise, aka, proper tongue and body posture is not guaranteed to work. (Basically forget about thumb pulling, bone smashing and excercises of similar nature that haven’t been approved by Mike himself)

-to get hollow cheeks, swallow correctly, mew and minimise buccinator usage in anything related to eating and chewing. A developing theory in certain forums is that open mouth chewing reduces buccinator usage and forces the tongue to move the food in the mouth but I personally don’t advocate for this. JUST DONT USE YOUR BUCCINATORS

-slightly controversial but it seemed to work for me: to raise even MORE of the back third after having suctioned the entire tongue, slide the tip of the tongue past the incisive papilla (basically touch the incisors) to reach all the way to your bottom incisors. By stretching the tongue forwards you are raising the back third even more. This is especially useful in recessed individuals. After having raised the back enough, slide the tip of the tongue back to the incisive papilla and leave it there. Note that when the tip is sliding along the top and bottom incisors, YOU ARE NOT APPLYING FORCE TO THE TEETH. YOU ARE SIMPLY TOUCHING THE BOTTOM AND TOP INCISORS VERY VERY GENTLY WHILE THE REST OF THE TONGUE IS SUCTIONED TO THE PALATE IN ORDER TO RAISE MORE OF THE TONGUE. YOU THEN RETURN THE TIP TO NORMAL POSTURE

Have the discipline to perfect your posture by following legitimate advice and no bs “easy methods”. You are RESHAPING your face the has deformed over time with due to bad habits. Have patience, work hard and achieve results


## The Ultimate Guide
Let's get started:

**Breathing**

- Breath through your nose all day, awake and during sleep. Consider nose breathing even during exercises.
- Avoid breathing with your chest. Adopt belly (Diaphragmatic) breathing. Practice the breath of fire (a breathing exercise) to encourage belly breathing.
- If you struggle breathing through your nose during sleep. Use a Humidifier, an Air Purifier or a Nasal Decongestant. Consider practicing the Buteyko or the Pranayama Breathing Technique. Consider visiting an ENT Specialist.
- If you struggle closing your mouth during sleep, consider mouth taping.

**Body Posture**

- **Fix all body posture problems:** Anterior pelvic tilt (Forward Hip Tilt), Hunchback, Forward head and Rounded shoulders.
- Practice the McKenzie Chin tuck.
- Do other Posture exercises.
- Stand and walk with a relaxed upright posture.
- Relax your shoulders.
- Avoid hunching, slouching and wobbling.
- When sitting, the height of knee should be below the hip and the feet should touch the floor.
- Avoid sitting on anything in your back pocket.
- Consider sitting at the edge of the chair.
- Consider practicing the meal time exercises, elbows off the table and food to your mouth not the other way around.
- Consider using a standing desk.
- When you are using a PC, laptop, phone, tablet, book, etc keep them around your shoulder height.
- Consider using your non-dominant hand more often.
- Free your feet as often as possible (go barefoot).
- Avoid too tight shoes and socks.
- Avoid footwear with high heel (higher than 1 inch, 2.54 in cm).
- Consider using Barefoot shoes like XeroShoes®, VivoBarefoot®, Freet®, LunaSandals® and BeLenka®.
- Consider using Posture Correctors like PostureQuickfix®, PostureProfix® and PostureNow®.

> Note: Relaying on posture correctors to fix your posture can be counterproductive since it can deactivate and atrophy the muscles used to hold your posture. If you want, look for posture correctors that are soft (they tend to not deactivate the muscles) or instead use posture trainer devices like Upright®.

- Consider visiting a Physiotherapist, an Osteopath or a Chiropractor.

**Sleeping Position**

- **Sleeping with Medical/Orthopedic/Ergonomic Pillow:** Opt to either Side sleeping or Back sleeping.
- **Sleeping with Regular/Cheap/Large Pillow:** Side sleeping Only.
- **Sleeping Without a Pillow:** Opt to either Side sleeping or Back sleeping.
- Never sleep on your stomach.
- Never place the back of hand, wrists, forearm or arm between the pillow or mattress and the cheek (Facial Pillowing).
- You can place the palm between the pillow or mattress and the cheek.
- With Side sleeping you can place the palm, back of the hand, wrists, forearm or arm between the pillow or mattress and the cranium situated above the cheek bone (Cranial Pillowing).
- If comfortable, you can lay your head directly on the pillow or mattress.
- If snoring, difficulty breathing or you have sleep apnea, avoid sleeping on your back.

**Tropic Premise/Mewing/Tongue Posture**

- Lips together, Teeth in light contact or slightly apart and Tongue on the roof of the mouth.
- The lips should be comfortably sealed together without mentalis muscle engagement.
- The lips should not just be kept together, they should be a little bit sucked in (Lips suction/Suction-seal).
- The tip of the tongue should be placed just behind the front teeth on the incisive papilla.
- Most of the tongue should placed on the roof of the mouth including the posterior third.
- Use the suction hold method to easily stick your tongue to the roof of the mouth. Consider maintaining a suction hold even while doing sports.
- A click sound generated from quickly opening the mouth or lowering the tongue, is a good sign of proper tongue posture. The louder the sound, the stronger the suction.
- A raise in the hyoid bone when attempting to mew, is a good sign of posterior third engagement.
- Inability to mouth breath while holding the tongue against the palate with mouth opened, is a good sign of proper tongue posture.
- If proper tongue posture is not achieved after enough practice, consider the fact that you might have a tongue tie, which should be released surgically. Consider performing tongue exercises. Consider using Myospots®, The Mewing appliance TM. Consider visiting a myofunctional therapist.

> For more info about Tongue-Tie visit [Dr. Soroush Zaghi's website](https://www.zaghimd.com/tongue-tie).

- If you can't seal your lips comfortably, practice the granny shock exercise ([link](https://youtu.be/0lV9zv2_vcg?t=645)).

**Chewing**

- **Soft Chewing:** chewing on regular gum (bolus or small) for long duration.
- **Hard Chewing:** chewing on Falim® gum (bolus or small), Mastic gum (bolus or small), Chisell® Tabs, Jawliner® Tabs, Jawinner® Tabs, Jawzrsize®, Dog Toys or regular gum (bolus or small) with cold water.
- Chew using your back teeth.
- Chew evenly on both sides.
- Chew your food slowly, steadily and properly 32 times or till it become mushy before swallowing.
- Closed mouth chewing.
- Maintain proper body posture while chewing. Consider tucking your chin slightly during chewing.
- Consider having your molars in contact with every bite.
- Consider massaging or stretching your chewing muscles by yawning or opening mouth widely after hard chewing or prolonged soft chewing.
- Consider taking a day or two days break every week from hard chewing and prolonged soft chewing.
- If you have weak chewing muscles, don't start hard chewing immediately instead, consider to gradually introduce hard food into your diet (from soft to hard/tough/chewy food).
- If you have asymmetry, chew more on the underdeveloped side.

> Note: some asymmetries are complex (caused by mandible dislocation, severe malocclusion or other unknown reason), these types of asymmetry might be fixed with the help of a specialist in the field of Oral and Maxillofacial pathology, probably it cannot be fixed by merely mewing and chewing.

**Swallowing**

- Swallow properly by practicing the cheesy smile swallow.
- Make sure not to suck on your teeth while swallowing.
- Makes sure not to use your buccinator muscle when swallowing.
- Makes sure your teeth are in contact or slightly apart during swallowing.
- Maintain proper body posture while swallowing. Consider tucking your chin slightly during swallowing.

**Tongue Exercises**

- **Tongue chewing:** squeezing a gum and flattens it or spread it against the roof of the mouth using your tongue.

> If done repeatedly, it could expand the upper dental arch.
> 
> Be mindful of your mandible position while practicing tongue chewing, avoid it's retraction to prevent the development of TMJD. Consider avoiding it entirely if you have TMJD.

- **Tongue cleaning:** using your tongue to clean your mouth from tiny food particles stuck between your teeth.
- **Tongue sweep:** moving your tongue on the insides between your cheek and teeth and the top and bottom.
- **Tongue stretching:** sticking your tongue out to reach your nose or chin.
- **Strengthening the back third of the tongue:** maintaining a suction hold and pushing on the palate using mainly the back third of the tongue while raising the head upward.
- **Exercise for a firmer suction hold:** hanging your head off the edge of the bed/bench, then repetitively lowering the head so chin is pointed up and bringing the chin to chest while maintaining a suction hold.

> It can be performed with added resistance.

- **Kechari Mudra Yoga.**

**TMJD Relief Tips**

> Note: Those whom have developed TMJD due to trauma, excessive chewing or poor posture will benefit the most from the following tips, otherwise a visit to an Oral and Maxillofacial Specialist, a TMJ Specialist, a TMJ Physiotherapist or a Neuromuscular Dentist is recommended:

- Never move, push or adjust your jaw using your hands (Only normal jaw movement, opening, closing, chewing and yawning).
- Open and close your mouth properly by protracting your mandible as you open and close your mouth. [Explanatory Video](https://youtu.be/3R8vdyFR-mE?t=98)
- Open your mouth widely while yawning (If it clicks, don't open too wide, open just before it does), (if your jaw deviate to one side while opening, try to open your mouth slightly toward the opposite side).
- Try opening your mouth while keeping tongue tip on the incisive papilla or while maintaining a suction hold (Do this as an exercise, if your TMJ clicks when you open your mouth).
- Eat spicy food, it will relax the muscles around your joint. As a substitute use hot or cold (if hot doesn't help) compresses.
- If the muscles around the joint feels stiff or tight (It will be eventually relieved), never adjust the jaw to relax it, it is a good sign of the joint positioning itself into a better position.
- Support your TMJ by training your chewing muscles, introduce hard food into your diet gradually (from soft to hard food). Be careful while chewing, try not to chew to the point where your TMJ start to make click or crunch noises. If excessive chewing was the cause of your TMJD, avoid hard chewing until recovery.
- Perform neck muscles stretches.
- Perform TMJ exercises, massages or stretches.
- Mew, swallow correctly and fix your posture.

**Approaches to Mewing with Over Bite/Deep Bite**

- Keeping the normal/habitual bite position, where molars are in contact (Conservative approach).
- Changing to a new bite position, where incisors are in contact (Non-Conservative approach).

> **Note:** Dr. Mike Mew is uncertain about this approach. Plus, it is difficult to maintain this new bite position.

​

ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

**Methods to Facilitate Mewing**

- **The n-spot:** Usually the first step taught to beginners. By saying the letter "n" the tip of the tongue will find its resting spot, at the incisive papilla. The incisive papilla is often referred to as the "n-spot."
- **The ng-spot:** One of the most common ways to learn to raise the middle and especially the posterior third(back) of the tongue. By saying a word containing the letter"-ng", such as king or sing, the tongue finds its resting spot. The middle goes up at the hard palate and the posterior third at the soft palate.
- **The g-trick:** Helps with spreading of the tongue. After finding the ng-spot, the tongue may be spread out by trying to say the letter "g". Since the tongue is held in place against the palate, the g will be inaudible, but the tongue will spread out as a result.

​

ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

**Different Ways to Mew**

- **Incisive/newbie mewing:** Only the tip of the tongue is placed on the incisive papilla, also known as the n-spot.

> It is a common mistake of people who have just heard about mewing to believe that this is proper mewing is.

- **Intermediate mewing:** The tip and middle of the tongue is placed on the roof of the mouth, without engaging the posterior third.

> Common for intermediate mewers to mistakenly believe that they are engaging the posterior third when keeping this posture.

- **The suction hold:** The whole tongue is suctioned up against the hard and soft palate, creating an inter oral vacuum.

> Commonly referred to as soft mewing. This is the kind of mewing that Dr. John and Mike Mew advocates.

- **Snore mewing:** Occurs when the posterior third is engaged, and blocks the airway.

> May be the true position of the tongue of in a recessed face. Very common for beginner mewers who try to learn how to engage the posterior third. Effective for building awareness of the tongue. Might be effective for training the posterior third and expanding the airways, but is highly uncomfortable and mentally taxing.

- **Breath/embarrassed mewing:** Functions the same way as snore mewing, but with less blockage of the throat, while still embarrassing the airway. This results in an audible breath, similar to the sound of a deep asleep person.

> May be the true position of the tongue of in a recessed face. Effective for building awareness of the tongue. Might have to upsides of snore mewing without the downsides. On the contrary, this can actually have a soothing effect on the mind.

- **Open mouth mewing:** How to do it: Put the whole tongue or just the posterior third on the roof of the mouth, while keeping an open mouth. Try breathe in through the mouth. You should be able to produce an audible snore. This is snore mewing. You may now close your mouth. Make sure to not change the position of the tongue. If you slightly reduce the blockage of the posterior third, you will end up with breath mewing.

> Technique to learn snore and breathe mewing. Also helpful to learn how to engage the posterior third. It is important to keep in mind that breath and snore mewing exists on a continuum. It is thus encouraged to experiment with different kind of engagement with the posterior third, to really get to know this important part of the tongue.

- **G-mewing:** Synonymous with the g-trick. Focuses on spreading the tongue laterally across the palate, which is important for its widening.
- **Medium mewing:** Less intense version of the different kinds of hard mewing. Might just be proper soft mewing, since most peoples tongues are weak.
