    Wake up earlier than usual, preferably before sunrise.

When you’ve waken up early and done productive things even before everyone else wakes up, it gives you a huge sense of accomplishment and this will carry you throughout the day. Wake up early AND sleep early, we want to get about 8-9 hours of sleep or MINIMALLY 6 hours of sleep. When I say sleep, I don’t mean lying on bed while using your phone.

    Eat healthier

The keyword here is healthier. Not everyone has the privilege to healthy food. In some places, healthy foods are even more expensive. The goal is trying to eat healthier rather than eating completely healthy. Take it day by day.

    Exercise at 30 minutes a day

This is the most obvious activity when it comes to self-improvement. Exercising makes you feel good, physically AND mentally. People are sleeping on how significant exercising can impact your mental health. Exercise is not limited to just the gym, it can be any physical activity such as home workouts, walking, skating, skipping ropes or anything that gets you moving.

    Reading atleast 5-10 pages a day

Some of you already love reading. The types of book we are targetting here are educational, finance, self-help or any non-fictional book that can benefit you. Book are unrated when it comes to acquiring knowledge or even skills.

    Meditate atleast 5-10 minutes a day

This is especially useful for those who have short attention span. Modern day social media has significantly reduce our attention span which has greatly impacted our mental health in many ways. The purpose of meditation is to improve mindfulness. This activity alone can greatly improve your mental health. You can search up meditation guides on the AppStore/PlayStore or on YouTube.

    Schedule your day

Your day starts the night before as you plan the following day. Setting goals for the day, planning your activites to the minutes keeps you organised. Not everything will go as planned but it’s better than being planless and procrastinating, feeling like you can never get things done as you’d hope.

    Track your progress

Track everything you do daily, from mediation to reading, preferably on a notebook (digitally is fine too). A checklist of your activities (good habits) allows you to feel accomplish, and encourages you to keep going. You can look back at the end of your 30 days and see how far you have come.

I hope this post is helpful to anyone who is lost or unsure of where or how to start your journey.

I’ve created an self-improvement challenge called #MIND30. It is meant for people who are keen to improve themselves but doesn’t know where or how to start. This challenge provides a baseline of good habits such as meditating, reading, etc. I know i’m not meant to promote anything, but i want to help as much people as i can.
