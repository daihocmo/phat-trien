You should create culture yourself, rather than consuming pop culture created for you (self.FoundationGuide)

This is a thought I've been having recently. A lot of people succumb to negative thoughts or self-destructive mindsets because they are attached to the pop culture that promotes these things. It's sad, because you see your friends and family going out to see movies or watching shows that you know promote bad values. Many people do not even recognize these values are bad until it's too late.

Regular people should start making culture ourselves. This can be something as simple as talking with friends rather than going out to see a Hollywood movie, or coming up with your own in-jokes instead of adopting them from the latest Netflix comedy show.

It can also be something more in-depth, such as actually creating your own game, music, movie, story, or other art. However, the most important thing to consider is if your art will be valuable to yourself or others, rather than merely an escapist time-waster. Art should exist to promote good values, not as a distraction from the responsibilities and opportunities of daily life.

In what ways do you think the average person could create or promote good culture?

I agree with you, I'm still good friends with a person i met and worked with during a highschool competition. It taught me valuable lessons and how to communicate with people. Made some in-jokes about our incompetence as novices too.


Try creating your own holidays.
Our culture has a lot of holidays that either exist for crass, commercial reasons (Mother’s Day, sorry Mom), or have been exploited as such (Christmas), or possibly never made sense in first place (St Patrick’s Day).

Why not create holidays for the things which are meaningful to you? That will remind you of what matters to you, that celebrates your values?

I’ve folded in a few existing non-holidays into my Calendar (420, Pi Day, Bicycle Day, May the 4th), in addition to making one or two out of whole cloth. In addition, last year I decided that January 1st was the stupidest day of the year to celebrate New Years, so I moved it to April 1st. Why not? For me, someone who takes self-improvement and reflection pretty seriously, and always made and then broke New Year’s resolutions, I had the blinding inspiration that trying to improve myself in the dead of winter was making a hard task near impossible.

I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Holidays today are often empty, vapid exercises in commercialism, totally devoid of whatever meaning they might once have held. So make the meaning yourself and celebrate your life.

I don’t celebrate Christmas, Easter, or Thanksgiving. I do celebrate Mardi Gras, the Harvest Moon in September, and Oktoberfest though. Just for shits and giggles.

Thanksgiving is one that I think has a lot of value, so long as you strip it of false cultural narratives (pilgrims etc) and commercial trappings.
But there’s some indication that showing gratitude and being grateful makes you a happier person, just by noticing the good things around you. So I think a holiday dedicated to that concept is useful in a fully actualized life.

This is an excellent suggestion. It really is sad how empty holidays have become.

Another suggestion could be to look to the past for inspiration with holidays, either adopting holidays that are no longer celebrated, or incorporating traditional aspects into holidays like Christmas to give them more substance than "let's buy stuff".
